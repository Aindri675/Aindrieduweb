    <h1>About Aindri EduWeb</h1>
    <p><strong>Aindri EduWeb</strong> was founded with a bold vision to revolutionize digital education and innovation across Papua New Guinea and the Pacific. What makes our story truly unique is that it all began at <strong>Sogeri National School of Excellence (NOSE)</strong>, a place known for academic excellence and innovation in learning.</p>

    <p>Inspired by the need to bridge digital gaps in education, Aindri EduWeb was conceptualized by young innovators who believed that every student, regardless of location, deserves access to quality digital tools, platforms, and knowledge.</p>

    <p>Our journey started in the classrooms and dormitories of Sogeri NOSE, where our co-founders combined their passion for STEM, education, and entrepreneurship to lay the foundations of what is now a growing digital innovation company. The supportive academic environment of NOSE enabled the team to experiment, research, and launch early prototypes that formed the basis of our current offerings.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To empower learners, educators, and communities through accessible and innovative digital solutions tailored for the developing world.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>To become a leading digital transformation agency in the Pacific region by building inclusive technologies that inspire creativity, collaboration, and progress.</p>

    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We embrace new ideas and push boundaries to find better solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Equity:</strong> We believe in equal access to knowledge and opportunity for all.</li>
      <li><strong>Community:</strong> We work with and for the communities we serve.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> We act honestly and ethically in everything we do.</li>
      <li><strong>Excellence:</strong> We strive for quality and continuous improvement in every project.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At Aindri EduWeb, we are proud of our roots and committed to our mission. As we grow, we continue to innovate and collaborate, remembering that it all started with a dream in Sogeri NOSE â€” and the future is just beginning.</p>
